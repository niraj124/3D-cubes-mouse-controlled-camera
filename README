This is a simple 3D block grid arrangement with a mouse controlled camera. For the camera working the Peasycam library for Processing 3 is used.

Steps to get it working:

1) Install Processing from this link:   https://processing.org/download/

2) Open the sketch included in the repo.

3) Add library by using Sketch-->Import Library--> Add Library -->PeasyCam (Search for Peasy Cam in search box)--> Install

4) Run the code.

Thank You!
